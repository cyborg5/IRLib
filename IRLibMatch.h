/* IRLibMatch.h from IRLib -- an Arduino library for infrared encoding and decoding
 * Version 1.5   June 2014
 * Copyright 2014 by Chris Young http://cyborg5.com
 *
 * This library is a major rewrite of IRemote by Ken Shirriff which was covered by
 * GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE which as I read it allows me to make modified versions.
 * That same license applies to this modified version. See his original copyright below.
 * The latest Ken Shirriff code can be found at https://github.com/shirriff/Arduino-IRremote
 * My purpose was to reorganize the code to make it easier to add or remove protocols.
 * As a result I have separated the act of receiving a set of raw timing codes from the act of decoding them
 * by making them separate classes. That way the receiving aspect can be more black box and implementers
 * of decoders and senders can just deal with the decoding of protocols. It also allows for alternative
 * types of receivers independent of the decoding. This makes porting to different hardware platforms easier.
 * Also added provisions to make the classes base classes that could be extended with new protocols
 * which would not require recompiling of the original library nor understanding of its detailed contents.
 * Some of the changes were made to reduce code size such as unnecessary use of long versus bool.
 * Some changes were just my weird programming style. Also extended debugging information added.

 * Originally all timing comparisons for decoding were based on a percent of the
 * target value. However when target values are relatively large, the percent tolerance
 * is too much.  In some instances an absolute tolerance is needed. In order to maintain
 * backward compatibility, the default will be to continue to use percent. If you wish to default
 * to an absolute tolerance, you should comment out the line below.

/*
 * These are some miscellaneous definitions that are needed by the decoding routines. 
 * You need not include this file unless you are creating custom decode routines 
 * which will require these macros and definitions. Even if you include it, you probably
 * don't need to be intimately familiar with the internal details.
