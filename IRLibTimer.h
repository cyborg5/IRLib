/* IRLibTimer.h from IRLib -- an Arduino library for infrared encoding and decoding
 * Version 1.5   June 2014
 * Copyright 2014 by Chris Young http://cyborg5.com
 *
 * This library is a major rewrite of IRemote by Ken Shirriff which was covered by
 * GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE which as I read it allows me to make modified versions.
 * That same license applies to this modified version. See his original copyright below.
 * The latest Ken Shirriff code can be found at https://github.com/shirriff/Arduino-IRremote
 * My purpose was to reorganize the code to make it easier to add or remove protocols.
 * As a result I have separated the act of receiving a set of raw timing codes from the act of decoding them
 * by making them separate classes. That way the receiving aspect can be more black box and implementers
 * of decoders and senders can just deal with the decoding of protocols. It also allows for alternative
 * types of receivers independent of the decoding. This makes porting to different hardware platforms easier.
 * Also added provisions to make the classes base classes that could be extended with new protocols
 * which would not require recompiling of the original library nor understanding of its detailed contents.
 * Some of the changes were made to reduce code size such as unnecessary use of long versus bool.
 * Some changes were just my weird programming style. Also extended debugging information added.

/* This file defines which timer you wish to use. Different versions of Arduino and related boards
  * have different timers available to them. For various reasons you might want to use something other than
  * timer 2. Some boards do not have timer 2. This attempts to detect which type of board you are using.
  * You need uncomment wish to use on your board. You probably will not need to include this in your
  * program unless you want to see which timer is being used and which board has been detected.

/* This file has been significantly reconfigured for version 1.5 and greater. It now
 * allows you use a different timer for input versus output. This also allows you to
 * use no timers whatsoever by using the IRrecvPCI or IRrecvLoop for input and
 * bit-bang routines for output. Note the various "Teensy" sections have not been tested.
